        <p>Hey everyone! My name is Ben Leong and I’m happy to be here! I have some coding experience, first dabbling with HTML way back in like ‘97-’98 of my freshman year of college when the interwebz was just starting to take off.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11vj0nqdYea1Qk/200.gif" width="80px"/><br>
        Anyone remember this gif???<br>
        <br>
        Yeah he found a spot on my SICK Angelfire page. [edit: damn, my old page doesn’t exist anymore!!] I got back into it a little bit later a few years ago with some online courses like Code Academy, Thinkful, etc. I loved to mess around with the code on the inspector tool and being able to find different solutions to the same goals.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I found W3 Schools, Stack Overflow and the like to be huge helps, but eventually got to the “informed pessimism” stage of my learning journey, and before I could find the determination to dig myself out, my wife and I had twins!</p>
        <br>
        <p>So we put coding on hold until now.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m currently a production designer for a sign company in Jersey where I spend most of my time working in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop creating layouts and production ready artwork. I do get to get creative every once in awhile, which is cool, but ultimately, I think something in web is where my heart’s always been at. [You can check out my resume <a href="file:///Users/Ben/Projects/GA-FEWD/About%20Me/bleong_resume%200814.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> if you’re interested.]</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I’m not saving .ai or .html files, I’m a family guy. As mentioned earlier, my beautiful, amazing wife and I have two very active 2-year old twins that have basically taken over our lives (and instagram feeds!) Anyone know any good babysitters in North Jersey?!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I’m pretty open with my work and in general, so swing by during lab to see what I’m working on, or if you want to bounce some ideas, or just to say hello.</p>
        <br>
        <p>That’s a little bit about me. What about you?</p>
